Welcome to the Test Automation Demo Project repository! This project showcases a comprehensive approach to test automation using various tools and frameworks. It is designed to serve as a reference for implementing automated tests in a real-world application.


Some of the key features of this framework:
Framework uses Page Object Design Pattern, hence there is clean separation between test code and page specific code such as locators and layout.
It generates Extent reports with all the step details.
It generates test execution log file.
The script can take screenshot of the failed step.
It can read input data from Configuration file.
